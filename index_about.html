                Before Heights <br><br>

                1922-1929: The Ateneo and the Ateneo Monthly <br><br>

                The Ateneo became the school's official news and literary magazine. Under the editorship of Edilberto S. Osmena, the magazine aimed to "cultivate literary excellence and to chronicle items of interest concerning alumni and student activities." Two months and two issues later, The Ateneo became The Ateneo Monthly. It continued to be the main campus organ for seven years, with its last issue becoming the school annual. <br><br>

                1929: The Ateneo Aegis <br><br>

                The last issue of The Ateneo Monthly came out, and was replaced by two new campus publications-The Guidon, which handled the news, and The Ateneo Aegis, which became the literary magazine and the school annual. <br><br>

                1931-1932: Wings <br><br>

                Since the Ateneo Aegis ceased to be a literary quarterly, the Poetry class of Fr. Hugh J. McLaughlin came out with a compilation of poems and critical essays on classical literary pieces. Called Wings, they produced two issues. Its editorial staff consisted of Horacio de la Costa, Jesus A. Paredes, Jr., Juan Atavadio and Jose S. Araneta. <br><br>

                1949-1952: The Ateneo Quarterly <br><br>

                The Ateneo Quarterly came out as a completely literary magazine under the editorship of Sixto Roxas, Maximo V. Soliven and Gregorio Brillantes, successively. <br><br>

                1952: The Death of Literature and the Birth of a New Publication <br><br>

                Upon moving from Padre Faura to Loyola Heights, The Ateneo Quarterly became HEIGHTS, named after the campus' lofty position in the hill overlooking Marikina. It has been the school's literary and artistic publication as we know it today. Ironically, the first editorial by Emmanuel Torres lamented the death of literature on campus. <br><br>

                In its early years, HEIGHTS sought to establish its own identity and role in the Ateneo. With Torres' assessment of literature on campus, HEIGHTS clearly assumed the role of a nest for the school's writers, where discourse could be conducted and insights discovered to help improve each other's writing. In the succeeding years, this role was developed further by its various editors and moderators. Fr. Miguel Bernad, S.J., moderator from 1954-1958 Christianized HEIGHTS with anthologies such as a tribute to the 1954 Marian Year-an issue celebrating ACIL's 50th year-and an Ignatian issue which centered on Gerard Manley Hopkins, Jesuit work and missions in the Philippines, and feature articles on "Queer Jesuits." <br><br>

                This Christianization was echoed in Alfredo R-A. Bengzon's 1954 editorial: "HEIGHTS is not merely a literary magazine designed to develop giants in the field of literature. Rather it is a channel for the clear expression of the thoughts and ideals of the Catholic college man."
