                Before Heights <br><br>

                1922-1929: The Ateneo and the Ateneo Monthly <br><br>

                The Ateneo became the school's official news and literary magazine. Under the editorship of Edilberto S. Osmena, the magazine aimed to "cultivate literary excellence and to chronicle items of interest concerning alumni and student activities." Two months and two issues later, The Ateneo became The Ateneo Monthly. It continued to be the main campus organ for seven years, with its last issue becoming the school annual. <br><br>

                1929: The Ateneo Aegis <br><br>

                The last issue of The Ateneo Monthly came out, and was replaced by two new campus publications-The Guidon, which handled the news, and The Ateneo Aegis, which became the literary magazine and the school annual. <br><br>

                1931-1932: Wings <br><br>

                Since the Ateneo Aegis ceased to be a literary quarterly, the Poetry class of Fr. Hugh J. McLaughlin came out with a compilation of poems and critical essays on classical literary pieces. Called Wings, they produced two issues. Its editorial staff consisted of Horacio de la Costa, Jesus A. Paredes, Jr., Juan Atavadio and Jose S. Araneta. <br><br>

                1949-1952: The Ateneo Quarterly <br><br>

                The Ateneo Quarterly came out as a completely literary magazine under the editorship of Sixto Roxas, Maximo V. Soliven and Gregorio Brillantes, successively. <br><br>

                1952: The Death of Literature and the Birth of a New Publication <br><br>

                Upon moving from Padre Faura to Loyola Heights, The Ateneo Quarterly became HEIGHTS, named after the campus' lofty position in the hill overlooking Marikina. It has been the school's literary and artistic publication as we know it today. Ironically, the first editorial by Emmanuel Torres lamented the death of literature on campus. <br><br>

                In its early years, HEIGHTS sought to establish its own identity and role in the Ateneo. With Torres' assessment of literature on campus, HEIGHTS clearly assumed the role of a nest for the school's writers, where discourse could be conducted and insights discovered to help improve each other's writing. In the succeeding years, this role was developed further by its various editors and moderators. Fr. Miguel Bernad, S.J., moderator from 1954-1958 Christianized HEIGHTS with anthologies such as a tribute to the 1954 Marian Year-an issue celebrating ACIL's 50th year-and an Ignatian issue which centered on Gerard Manley Hopkins, Jesuit work and missions in the Philippines, and feature articles on "Queer Jesuits." <br><br>

                This Christianization was echoed in Alfredo R-A. Bengzon's 1954 editorial: "HEIGHTS is not merely a literary magazine designed to develop giants in the field of literature. Rather it is a channel for the clear expression of the thoughts and ideals of the Catholic college man."

            <button class="accordion">A Political Shift</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>From 1957 to the early 70's, HEIGHTS experienced a gradual change from its religious orientation to a political one. The 1957 issues no longer donned the traditional cover design by Emmanuel Torres (wherein Ateneo is perched on a cliff over Marikina Valley). HEIGHTS started experimenting with various media and art forms. Antonio F. Samson's first editorial criticized the rise of nationalism in the country, however, the stories and essay's that he published reflect nationalistic orientation. After Fr. Miguel Bernad relinquished moderatorship to Fr. James T. Griffin in 1958, the staff affirmed his policy of using the magazine as an "outlet for the Atenean apostolate... and that the articles should be pervaded with Catholicism." Despite this, it was the nationalistic texts which dominated and Contributing Editor Roman A. Cruz, Jr. criticized HEIGHTS of its "ivory tower" mentality.

                HEIGHTS saw itself reexamining its own ideas of literature. Contributions for Poetry increased, adding to the traditional essays and stories that were staples in HEIGHTS.

                In 1963, an issue devoted entirely to essays was released with its editors lamenting on the impending death of campus literature. Also, few essays published in this time reflected the Atenean's concern over topics such as communism, and the effects of certain historical events to the country's ongoing political struggles.

                Art and book design, for the first time, played an important role in packaging these poems and political articles-culminated in an issue made up of different pamphlets and sheets of paper placed inside a box of Tide-either to spite the quality of works that have been passed or to "get closer to the Masses."</p>

            <button class="accordion">"Poetization" and "Filipinization"</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>By the late 60's, poetry became the dominant genre in the publication and in 1965, HEIGHTS published its first set of Filipino works through the launch of the Bagay Movement. Started by a group of Ateneo faculty and students, the Bagay Movement produced poems that made use of concrete images and conversational language. <br> <br>  

                1969 saw the first editorial written in Filipino by B. Basildez Bautista, and the entry of its first Filipino Editor, Perfecto Martin. By then, HEIGHTS echoed the radical student activism that characterized the times and even changed its name to Pugadlawin in school year 1971-1972 with Jose Ma. Sison as guest editor. This publication, however, died with the implementation of Martial Law in 1972. <br> <br>  

                HEIGHTS resurrected in October 1974. Afraid of radicalism that redirected its concerns in the past years, HEIGHTS reestablished its policies and mission as the school literary organ. It placed "the cultivation of the craft of writing" as its first priority. Interdisciplinarity or a wide range of concerns and foci-not just on the political sphere-became its second agenda. HEIGHTS also addressed issues on bilingualism, saying that it will continue to accept works written in English and Filipino, and stressed the need to cultivate Filipino. <br>  <br>  

                The first issue released after the death of Pugadlawin was dominated by translations. For the first time, HEIGHTS consciously develops a criteria for selecting works for publication, stressing that although a work may be relevant to the times, it must, first of all, be well-written. 1975-76 saw the reaffirmation of these objectives. Not only did they focus more on craft, they took time to seek out examples of the kind of craft they were looking for in contributions. <br> <br>  

                In the school year of 1976-77, HEIGHTS came out with an issue entirely in Filipino. The issue on language was tackled by Rolando Tinio. Also, HEIGHTS members offered services to their contributors as literary advisers. <br> <br>  

                Although language can pose a serious problem to writers, by 1980, HEIGHTS exhibited competence and ease in handling both Filipino and English works. Filipino and English Deliberating Staffs were established.</p>
